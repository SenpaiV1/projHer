      I love you.<br>
      I'm thankful for everything that you have done for me this year, thank you for understanding me.<br>
      It's been a rough year for you and for me, especially for you, I'm proud of you, for enduring this year.<br>
      Always remember that I'm here for you through ups and downs, that I'm always proud of your achievements, from the smallest things to the biggest.<br>
      I'll always be there for you, even if I'm at my lowest (doubt that will ever happen since I have you hehe).<br>
      In all lifetimes, in all possibilites, I'll always find you, love you, and make you the happiest girl, for that, I'll try my best. I love you, my love of my life<br>
      <div class="tomy" style="text-indent: 90px;">forever yours, Nella</div>
